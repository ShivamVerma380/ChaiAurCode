# ChaiAurCode
As I wanted to take a beginner friendly app for students to teach them about android development ,so I made a basic app on the famous meme Chai Piyo Aur Code Karo . The app has main activity in which user has to enter his name and has two options :
1. He/she loves coding.
2. He/she does not love coding.
